With this plugin you can create a spritesheet and corresponding CSS code by following these simple steps:

1. Begin by selecting the specific layers you wish to include in your spritesheet. These layers can consist of individual elements, icons, or any other visual components that you want to combine into a single image.

2. For each element within the spritesheet, specify the desired height and width. This ensures that all elements are uniform in size and neatly arranged within the spritesheet.

3. Customize the spacing and layout of the spritesheet according to your preference. You can adjust the spacing between individual elements to create a visually appealing arrangement. Additionally, you have the flexibility to choose the overall layout, such as a grid pattern or a linear arrangement.

4. Once you have finalized the settings, simply click the "Generate" button. The plugin will then automatically generate the spritesheet image and the corresponding CSS code required to utilize it in your web development projects.
